Hey, my name is Gerrit and I've been a web developer for three years now. Over
time, I've seen applicants struggle with their application letters, in
interviews and in coding challenges. Most of the time it's junior developers who
are trying to score their first job in the real world and fail.

My goal with this blog is to help junior developers to overcome the obstacles,
learn the important bits, focus on the things that really matter, improve their
code quality, application letters and communication skills and finally get the
entry-level position in web development they desire and deserve.

This blog focuses on Javascript, but I hope that most advice is somehow
transferable into the language of your choice. Cheers.
